Spherical Speaker
=================

I would like to use my 3D printer to build a custom spherical bluetooth speaker. This repo contains my CAD as well as my though process

# Why a sphere?

From what I've gathered, an ideal speaker box would have an infinate volume.
The "important air" is the air being pushed towards you by the driver.  The air
on the other side of the driver (inside the speaker box) has potential to
cancel out the desired sound.  By having a huge speaker volume, there is plenty
of space for the air to move without it reflecting back and canclling out the
outside air.

This prinicpal is what drew me towards a sphere.  A Sphere is the most
efficient way of storing a given volume.  THerefore, a sphere that looks the
same size as a cube will have a much large volume.  

Historically, speakers have tended to be boxes because boxes are easy to build.
Cut 6 peices of wood, glue them togehter and you have yourself a speaker box.
Building a sphere out of wood would be insanely difficult (i assume).  THis all
changes when you account for 3D printers.  3D printers can make a box just as
easy as it can make a sphere.  

# Ported

I decided to add a port for my intial version.  A ported speaker lets you amplifiy a certain frequency by sizing the port to resonate.  THis lets us beef up the low end

# Drivers

I will use a 3" Woofer and a 1" tweeter.

Intially, I wanted to just use a single. 3 inch full range driver. However, on my very first iterration, i was missin the trbbel when comparing to an off-the-shelf speaker.  I was happy with the bass, so i decided to add a single driver.



# Construction

Print the speaker with PETG.

Coat the inside of the speaker with a laquor to seal up andy small holes.

Fill the speaker shell with Deep Pour epoxy.  Deep pour expoxy cures slowly and emite heat slower.  This will prevent the plastic from melting, warping.
